// This is a simple program that turns on and off different colors of LED2 based on
// which button is pushed
// -the two pushbuttons are P1.1(S1) and P1.4(S2)
// -The LED is controlled by P2.0(red), P2.1(green) and P2.2(blue)
// -In this program, S1 will turn green on or off and S2 will
// turn blue on or off
// -If the color is off, pressing the pushbutton will turn it on
// -If the color is on, pressing the pushbutton will turn it off
//
//This program is written for the MSP432 Launchpad development board.
